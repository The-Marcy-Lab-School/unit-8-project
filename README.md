# Unit 8 (Mini) Project: Build a React App!

## Directions
Congratulations! You've made it to the end of our React unit! Now it's time to solidify and extend upon your foundational knowledge by building a small project that pushes you to bring multiple concepts together.

This task is basically a remix on our Unit 6 Project. Your assignment is to build a frontend application that leverages the React library. The requirements of this project are straightforward. You must build a frontend application that fetches data from some external API and presents some novel view or insights based on that data. Like last time, I encourage you to choose a problem, data set, or API that you are personally interested in. However, the curricular focus for this project is your UI. As such, prefer simpler APIs/data sets that you can fashion complex UIs around.

Consider the following APIs:
  1. [Edamam (Recipes + Food Info)](https://developer.edamam.com/)
  2. [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
  3. [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/api)
  4. [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
  5. [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api)
  6. [538](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)
  7. [Rap Genius](https://docs.genius.com/)
  8. [Fortnite Stats](https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api)

There is so much more out there too! Check out this [repo of open APIs on GitHub](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)!

Lastly, **you can also just refactor your unit 6 project to use React**! This is a great opportunity to shore up the UI for that project so that you can add it to your portfolio!

## Project Guidelines

* Your UI must be composed primarily of functional componets that use React Hooks to maintain state and make your asynchronous requests.
* Add some client side routing with React Router.
* If you find yourself ["prop drilling"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling/) use Context to maintain some global state.
